##Hypothesis
What is the most relevant day of the week to be active in ProductHunt? 
- Based on posts, votes and comments

## Tools and Process
- MySQL database and SQL queries to collect data
- Python to process data
- Excel to generate graphics

## Analysis and Results

## Conclusion
- Weekends are not as popular
- The middle of the week is usually when users are active the most
- More activity = more likely that your post will receive attention (not entirely because there are other variables involved)

## Challenges and Future Work
- Verify activity in the days of the week through the months
- Add relationship between when users logged in according to the day of the week (if data available)
- Votes and comments are not necessarily associated with the day of the week presented
